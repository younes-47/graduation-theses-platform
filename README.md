*   The web application is mainly in French. Please consider using a translator extension such as Google Translator or your browser's built-in translator to translate the entire page.
*   default login for the admin:  
    username: **admin @uit.ac.ma**  
    password: **admin2022**
    
    The system automatically generates cridentials for the added users (professors and students) by concatinating their names, the university's domain name and the academic year 2022.
    
    For example, let's assume we have added a student called Younes Khoubaz. The cridentials are as follows:  
    username: **"younes.khoubaz @uit.ac.ma"**  
    password: **youneskhoubaz2022**  
    _(can be changed after logging in via the profile page)_.
    

What does this application solve ?
------------------------

In any university, it is difficult for the administration to manage graduation projects. Each student chooses their topic and proposes it to the administration, which either accepts or rejects it. If it accepts it, it takes care of fixing the date of each thesis, reserving a room and assigning the professors as examination boards.This involves several issues if it is done without the help of technology, for example, it is very difficult to search the history of theses. It is also very difficult to organize all the projects with their dates. Not to mention that it can also lead to incorrect room allocations, if two theses defenses are accidentally fixed in the same room at the same time.

### A Walkthrough

After logging in, we can see that the student has not yet chosen their project topic yet (projects chosen by other students are shown to avoid choosing the same topic which could lead to rejection).

After the student have chosen their project topic, it appears on the projects page in the admin dashboard.

  

#### Admin-Dashbaord

The administrator can view the list of projects selected by each student. He also has the option of accepting the project and thus proceed with scheduling or rejecting the project.

When scheduling a thesis presentation, the admin must reserve a room, assign the exam committees and set a specific date and time.

The system then checks if there is a confusion and act accordingly.

After the thesis has been successfully scheduled, it will appear on the theses page for the admin to edit or view. It cannot be deleted as the system archives all theses.
